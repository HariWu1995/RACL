there were a lot of people waiting meaning there was a shortage of seating . cutlery ran out and had to ask for some too .
i waited 1 hr . and 20 min .
great c / s one step ahead
phone to work in room hot water
the hotel had nice decor , accessible nice gym , and really comfortable pillows . i liked the nice cute atmosphere of the entrance area and room i stayed in .
room was ok doors sticks room phones didn ' t work
bananas were very freckled .
i loved the bar and the food in the cafe de la paix .
air conditioning not working was disappointing and hotel staff left our window open which was a security risk i was not happy with . apart from that rooms and front desk girls were great . breakfast was good value .
clean sheets and properly working equipment . . . . i thought i was going to puke when i rolled over the next morning and there was makeup all over the bottom sheet . i was not wearing makeup .
if there were more accessible outlets . the price of parking wasn ' t so high .
would like to be able to get a better coffee at the hotel . the hotel needs a decent western restaurant . evening buffet dinner at the restaurant was not very nice . all the foods had chinese flavours .
( especially the bali wine could be a lot cheaper as i know places that serve the same wine with much lower price . )
bar prices are on the high side for a bottle of beer - better value drinking local when it would have been nice to stay at the hotel for a few drinks
the rooms were super clean , and the accommodations were excellent ! it was 10 minutes from my brother ' s house in port st . lucie and our family enjoyed time together without traveling far .
and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . for the number of people , an extra would be helpful .
this room was disgusting ! the room smelled strongly of paint , head board torn up , and the bites that i had on my legs were unacceptable . yes , i did call after the stay .
if there were more accessible outlets .
a garden with fountain and flowers and outdoor dining is missing .
the overall price for a twin room was reasonable . the room was cleaned to a high standard .
the rooms given to us this time were not upto the mark . curtains were unsatisfactory have lived their life and need to be discarded . no faucets in the bathroom no complimentry fruits .
internet connection would not hold on laptop . room temp was 61 with ac on when we arrived . poor lighting at desk area . nightstand clock set on 24 hour display . no one knew how to change to 12 hour display .
beautiful old building and nice atmosphere
much better on the trasportation from the ship . i waited 1 hr . and 20 min .
softer bed . english speaking channels on tv .
no one paying attention at the front desk .
been here prior .
no ice on our floor . 2 . no shower mat for bathtub . had to use towel bath mat while we showered .
there were only meat choices . . . there was queso , but there were no chips . . .
it was christmas weekend , so there were families in different places and kids were allowed to run wild .
the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile . the tile grout in the shower was stained . the tub drain looked filthy . 3 . the noise from the air conditioning units on the adjacent building was excessively loud and disturbing .
it was cold in my room ( cold weather ) . it took a colleague to suggest shutting the air conditioner off instead of raising the temperature so that it did not come on ( limited ) .
room service would be an added plus for this hotel . a variety in breakfast would also be a plus .
the service , cleanliness , and breakfast were all very good . the staff was very friendly and helped me when needed over the course of my stay . the room was well kept and fairly modern . food was very good in the morning .
ata gap that allowed a lot of noise from the hall way and there was a big party there
' . oh wait , there it is ' .
were unsatisfactory have lived their life and need to be discarded . no
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . there was queso , but there were no chips . . . i asked for chips & was told there weren ' t any ? so , i ' m not sure why there was queso ?
softer bed .
better kids buffet - mash as well as chips , more veg choices , chicken leg and other non - fried mains . better coffee machines in the restaurant . they kept breaking and were nowhere near as good as coffee from the bar .
glass is totally see through . you can totally hear the sound from inside . makes it awkward .
i didn t understand how the windows all looked out on this depressing empty square of empty buildings . a garden with fountain and flowers and outdoor dining is missing .
convenient to my meeting destination and local restaurants
the onsite bar and restaraunt were nice nd the wait staff was fantastic
would also be nice to be able to use the app to enter your room as well
i stayed on ash wednesday . there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . there was queso , but there were no chips . . . i asked for chips & was told there weren ' t any ? so , i ' m not sure why there was queso ?
fast check in friendly staff great rooms
and they were pretty loud in the halls and the bathtub needs some updated chaulk around the seals
no more fruit at 1000 .
this room was disgusting ! the room smelled strongly of paint , head board torn up , and the bites that i had on my legs were unacceptable .
it was a pleasure to stay at the hotel .
air conditioning could not be regulated prprtly
road noise from window that was shut but sounded as if it was open ? noise from people in corridor outside . . noise from bathroom upstairs
friendly staff .
had to wait and to get attention when i first arrived . no one paying attention at the front desk .
would like to be able to get a better coffee at the hotel . the hotel needs a decent western restaurant . evening buffet dinner at the restaurant was not very nice .
i felt very welcome .
reception was excellent on arrival .
the staff were very friendly and helpful . the all dasy food menu was excellent , covering all tastes and the food ordered was hot and exceptionally tasty . room service was very prompt and unlike a large number of hotels was hot and well presented .
a new bed . the one we had was old and saggy . complete my profile requested room .
the staff could not have been more accommodating . we had breakfast two mornings , and the food was cooked perfectly to order . and served with the same friendly service .
the food at the bar was well prepared and the bartender was extremely nice . the cooks did well on my specific request on seasoning on the food .
also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , when i was checking out , i asked the hotel staff assistance with the computer
they upgraded me to a suite
the breakfast was disappointing . the food was all processed and salty . sausage was dry and very spicy .
staff were friendly and accommodating . the water in the lobby was delightful . a free breakfast would have been a plus
the bar was out of tap beer 2 days in a row . bartender was overwhelmed and had troubles all night . pos system was down for both days - made paying a process
the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays .
so the temperature was quite uncomfortable especially at night .
not so overpowering with the air freshener used . it was so bad we had to ask the staff to use something to neutralize the smell . but it was still strong the next day .
i received change easily for the coffee main in the lobby .
the employees , from young lady that cleaned our rooms to every personnel in the restaurant during breakfast and at the front dest were very accommodating , courteous , and knowledgeable .
the food in the bar cafe was really bad . super salty , few healthy selections - ie the buffalo chicken wrap chicken was deep fried , didn ' t say that on the menu or i wouldn ' t have ordered it .
beautiful hotel .
the bar area was lacking atmosphere .
we would love to stay once more for the ambience and breakfast we had we enjoyed . the reservation dept .
the bar area closest to reception was rather bare , bright and soulless . check in was rather slow ; the reception desk is cramped and there was no recognition of ihg rewards membership .
the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . 2 .
i put together a salad .
laundry facility & more workout equipment
bed , pillows and linens were comfortable .
the view from the room , proximity to the beach and attractions , the restaurant , the staff
more selection on the menu would be good .
free breakfast coupons
the customer service was really lovely from the moment you step into the hotel lobby for the check - in to the time you check - out . we even had help to get a taxi sorted for an event we were attending that weekend . very friendly and kind . the rooms were really clean and for me as an ocd sufferer
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design . instead of remaking , he just scrapped the mushrooms off the steak and cooked the steak to well done .
updated rooms , fast and helpful check in
thank you
comfortable accommodation .
great customer
the staff were all very friendly , polite and hospitable . i felt very welcome . the room was very comfortable .
clean rooms , clean sheets / towels , smelled fresh . super warm pool - thank you ! loved the complimentary bottled water , coffee and fruit , and loved the brain teasers and what not , though i forgot to turn mine in for the raffle .   : )
nice facility with comfortable rooms and friendly service .
much faster internet , a table to eat my food on , a clean room , no food left in the refridgerator , no left over trash on room floor and bathroom floor . a professional staff that delivers what they promise . no burned out lite bulbs .
the food at breakfast was much better , so was the service . i m planning a family reunion here in 2020 and hope the dinner food improves before then or we will dine elsewhere for dinner
room 322 smelled like mildew . mold or black mold in the bathroom .
newer decor . breakfast .
bed bugs !
plenty of coffee .
room service could be better .
the one we had was old and saggy . complete my profile requested room . i am a platinum member and on my profile i request a room on the higher floor away from the elevator .
they were all over some food and tooth paste
will not stay here again !
especially mr . shayan was very polite and made arrangements according to our convineint tim which made our stay comfortable and happy .
meals in bar a little too expensive
front desk does not know how to take initiatives . when checking in it took the 3rd room to get it right . did doors did not lock .
the one we had was old and saggy . complete my profile requested room .
storing luggage with duty free items so i don ' t have to haul luggage since i plan to come back
better breakfast . i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels and i have to say this was the worst breakfast i have experienced . the bagels were hard . there was only one cinnamon roll . no oatmeal or pancake batter ( it was not all gone , it was never set out ) .
cleaner walls , fresh smell in the room , dusted furniture and dusted tissue holder , unstained carpet , outlets that aren ' t falling out of the wall , bathroom ceiling not stained , hallway walls not stained , overall update of the hotel
i forgot my breakfast coupon and the front desk gave me a coupon rather than me having to go all the way back to my room . the whole experience met my needs for my 4 day stay !
not bar soap but a body wash .
better bar ambience
so the temperature was quite uncomfortable especially at night . other than that the stay was great
and 20 min .
breakfast was of quality , and the waitress left the pot of coffee on the table . i watched a new hire being trained on the buffet line by the chef . i was impressed with this level of supervision being provided to insure quality food service .
better choice of beer in the bar .
but it would have been nice to catch the news .
newer decor . breakfast . free wifi .
room service was horrible . shrimp poboy and chicken sandwich bread were both hard as a rock .
our service was friendly , prompt , and we were greeted with smiling , friendly personnel for our entire stay . the staff could not have been more accommodating .
also making sure the utensil trays are filled , without having to be asked three times to refill .
great service by the breakfast team - special mention of john , satish who took great care to ensure the service was up to the mark delectable food and dessert dishes
complete my profile requested room .
also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , and she wasn ' t customer service oriented nor friendly .
missed the ambience of a hotel bar
could not access both sides of both beds due to the smallness of the room . realize this is an old hotel , but perhaps the room could be arranged better for access of bedding . also betting was thin .
so clean up and earn the money that is required to rent this !
cheaper bar menu
improve drinks at the bar . not all wines available and some spirits .
the beds were hard 3 )
the room was larger and also very clean .
appreciated that there was a microwave and refrigerator in the room if i had a need for these .
cleanliness of the room .
better breakfast . i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels
from reception to the waiters in the bar and the restaurant and from the valet at the door till the house keeping staff in the corridors . rooms were well appointed , very clean and the bed comfort was excellent !
better breakfast options such as variety of fruits , cereal , and bread also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , but they need to improve on their friendliness .
bed bugs ! got bit about at least 20 , all over me , finger , arms , legs , thighs , feet , back . the manager changed the room for me , but still itching , hurting and bleeding for 3 weeks , i went to the doctor office and got some medicine .
newer facility , nice comfortable rooms , convenient location for my needs .
i stayed on ash wednesday . there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad .
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design . elevator was slow . restaurant screwed up my meal . instead of remaking , he just scrapped the mushrooms off the steak and cooked the steak to well done . bartender was cool and bought me some beer but cook should be disciplined . i saw others at the bar shaking their heads and complains their food was wrong too .
the reception at the desk at check in was very warm and pleasant . room was clean and comfortable .
when they heard that i could not eat many of the items on the breakfast buffet , they offered to individually cook some egg whites for me , which i really appreciated . they , as well as the folks working the front desk , were very helpful over our entire stay .
air conditioning not working was disappointing and hotel staff left our window open which was a security risk i was not happy with . apart from that rooms and front desk girls were great . breakfast was good value . location excellent !
the room was excellent and beautiful .
the staff was very friendly , professional and helpful . the room was very comfortable and clean .
my son found a plastic piece in his scrambled eggs . more attention is needed by cooking staff . breakfast was limited , would like to see more vegetarian options . room service did not show up until we requested .
early morning softball games meant leaving the hotel right when breakfast was opened up to eat . also breakfast needed to get refilled more often . we had to leave for a hame .
this has always been my favorite hotel in baltimore but had to change rooms three times to find a room with a working heating system . totally unacceptable .
it feel like it was ran by a true team / family .
better lighting in the bedrooms - i have to sit in the dining area to read the paper . mushrooms and / or tomatoes for breakfast . we were not aware or the industrial cleaning evening when we could not use the bar / dining area to sit in .
housekeeping ensured that the room was clean and up to the standards .
reception check in where great - polite , friendly , helpful . room decor .
the batter / pancakes come out yucky . a belgian waffle maker would be so much better !
1 1 . the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile . the tile grout in the shower was stained . the tub drain looked filthy . 3 . the noise from the air conditioning units on the adjacent building was excessively loud and disturbing .
the service has always been great .
each and every staff member was pleasant and extremely helpful . the facility itself was very clean and all amenities were excellent , including the breakfast and evening meals . keep up the amazing work .
would like to be able to get a better coffee at the hotel . the hotel needs a decent western restaurant . evening buffet dinner at the restaurant was not very nice . the worst was the icecream , which seemed to have very strange flavours such as durian , onion and red bean .
the sports bar has a great relaxed atmosphere .
good amenities in the room .
the food was cold .
they were frozen and would take forever to thaw . we ordered caesar salad and chicken wings and they were at a great price and delicious .
not sure what the person ' s job was that seated us , but she had plenty of time to get coffee and do other jobs .
the service from the point i arrived to when i left was excellent . the two members of staff that stood out are ms laura t franco , she really looked after me and nicola baeoni . everything was as expected and better .
very friendly and kind .
wine selection was poor and pricey .   ( especially the bali wine could be a lot cheaper as i know places that serve the same wine with much lower price . )
i had a suite room and the outer room of the suite was very warm and the air / fan or whatever it was called did not keep the room cool . we even left the door open of our bedroom but the a / c did not cool the room terrible ventilation .
internet connection would not hold on laptop . room temp was 61 with ac on when we arrived . poor lighting at desk area .
there were a lot of people waiting meaning there was a shortage of seating .
during check out , front desk said i needed to call a 3rd party vendor .
also apparently there was an issue with the circulating hot domestic water .
mosquito spray in rooms would have been helpful
the roof top bar environment shd be such where single women can sit and ejoy a drink too .
no left over trash on room floor and bathroom floor . no burned out lite bulbs .
we even had help to get a taxi sorted for an event we were attending that weekend . the rooms were really clean and for me as an ocd sufferer
she pleasantly served me two poached eggs on toast as requested but a different assistant during the week would not budge from the menu ie . continental no variation .
the desk clerk on duty when we arrived late at night was very friendly and helpful with directions .
better breakfast options such as variety of fruits , cereal , and bread also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , but they need to improve on their friendliness . when i was checking out , i asked the hotel staff assistance with the computer
the staff was rude , the hotel was dirty and had boxes full of heaters in the lobby . in addition the room was out dated and needed to have new pillows , new pull out coach mattress that included bedding .
plumbing was bad . . . a few bugs in the room . . . maybe bugs could be removed . . . . . should check toilet before next person . . . .
also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working .
mold or black mold in the bathroom . i have pictures . late booking late arrival it s still charge me full price .
a lobby bar to have after work drinks and better breakfast options ( food was incredibly bland ) . water bottles in the room would ' ve been a recommended touch as well .

the overall appearance was shoddy . the fixtures and fittings were in a very bad condition , with dirty carpets , broken bathroom tiles and a divan bed that was falling apart . the towels were also worn and old .
took a long time for the heating to warm the roof bar meals were quite basic
were unsatisfactory have lived their life and need to be discarded . no no complimentry fruits .
polite and clean . easy check in and out .
obviously , the mechanism hadn ' t been cleaned in years .
fortunately , there were never many at one time , and we know they can be hard to get rid of , but we would prefer not to have ants . i really can ' t think of anything else , though . we loved our stay .
apology when finally checking in and without any need to ask was offered complimentary parking . great c / s one step ahead
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . there was queso , but there were no chips . . .
the parking lot was big enough for all the guests .
clean rooms with all amenities . very nice staff
this is the first hotel that i have ever stayed at that i had to pay for breakfast . instead of a free continental breakfast i was forced to pay $ 10 for breakfast and then an extra $ 2 for coffee at my breakfast table when there was free coffee 50 feet away outside the restaurant .
the room was outstanding , very comfortable bed and the furnishings just made the room very much like being at home . the touch lamp was a great addition to the work area . the lounge chair was just a wonderful place to sit and relax .
easy access of main motorway . room pleasant and large enough for our family . use of gym and pool great .
the bathroom was very dated , the blockout blinds did not block out all of the light and there was an air vent that was quite noisy all night . it would be good to be able to control the air and temperature and turn it off at night .
the food at breakfast was much better , so was the service .
the wrong bar menu was in my room so i couldn ' t order the meal i wanted when i got to the bar .
we had evening drinks there and bar could look nicer though again the staff compensate for the unfinished look of the bar .

room pleasant and large enough for our family . use of gym and pool great . breakfast good selection . easy reach of attractions in surrounding area . friendly staff in all areas .

great customer service , great breakfast selection very kind and friendly staff , shuttle to airport was a plus
much better on the trasportation from the ship . i waited 1 hr .
more hanger / storage space in room ; safe in room .
screen on door / window
there was blood all over the carpet and not enough lights in parking lot with drug deals going on where my vehicle was parked .
some one to carry in my bags . having my check in requests addressed .
eliminate strange hallway odor ,
room was clean and real glasses ( that ' s a plus compared to recent stays in hotels at a much higher price ) . good wi - fi connection . enjoyed the breakfast and the eating area . good service from the front desk especially meghan .
the staff were all very friendly , polite and hospitable . i felt very welcome . the room was very comfortable . the sports bar has a great relaxed atmosphere . the shop is well stocked with a good variety of good quality curios and other items . food / meals were excellent .
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad .
front desk does not know how to take initiatives . when checking in it took the 3rd room to get it right . considering first night included a fire evacuation caused by one of their dryers .
dinner at the restaurant was horrible dumped butter on everything to try to make it taste better
friendly and helpful staff . great breakfast , even on christmas eve and christmas when many were being served .
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design . elevator was slow . restaurant screwed up my meal . instead of remaking , he just scrapped the mushrooms off the steak and cooked the steak to well done . bartender was cool and bought me some beer but cook should be disciplined . he messed up other food orders too i saw others at the bar shaking their heads and complains their food was wrong too .
i stayed
the hotel was not a clean as i expected it to be .
very dangerous situation with an already injured knee .
room service came by at 8 : 30 each morning . that seemed excessively early . i ' d like the ability to sleep or go for breakfast and head out for the day before someone shows up at the door .
bar area lacks atmosphere , so most guests in our party used another .
need to check food quality before it goes out
, tables were not cleaned , no silverware , food was cold no one to help . you ' re going to say you had large groups so if you knew it then you should have had more staff on those days .
the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile .
i stick to vegan food and was upset about the lack of breakfast choices for me .
my membership was not on file on arrival . . ' . oh
the front desk guy wouldn t let us check - in 30 mins early . will not stay here again ! the best western right up the road looks a lot nicer and easier to get to .
ni ordered room service
club lounge access for ambassador members
the food was cold . the new food brought out and added to the buffet is cold so that is how i know it
the bathroom cleanliness was questionable and room service failed to respond to our request . if the bathroom is not clean the whole room becomes questionable .
with regard to food hygiene , there was no staff looking after the food and there were birds eating off the ingredients of the egg live station
update ! hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design .
the bathroom cleanliness was questionable and room service failed to respond to our request . if the bathroom is not clean the whole room becomes questionable . used wipes to clean dirty surfaces . still waiting for room service . . .
provide beach chairs and umbrellas as part of $ 25 fee .
i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels the hotel was not that busy the night we stayed .
window into lobby was weird and made room noisey
breakfast : get rid of the pancake machine - the batter / pancakes come out yucky .
these ones tasted awful ( i didn ' t know you could have bad english muffins ) .
they were all over some food and tooth paste we ' d left in the bathroom and had planned to eat on our return drive home to northern california .
said that some of the rooms had them and some did
ordered food at 6 : 30pm , got food at 7 : 45pm .
the air con was not working and it wasn t an extremely hot day so the temperature was quite uncomfortable especially at night . this is the main reason for the low rating on meeting my expectations .
fix the buffet breakfast . the food was cold . they appear to be cooking mounds of food early am and then holding it in the back and keep adding to the buffet as needed . the new food brought out and added to the buffet is cold so that is how i know it
excellent service and help given by all members of staff with whom we came into contact . the cleanliness in all areas of the hotel , the efficiency of re stocking breakfast items and clearing of tables with minimum of fuss , plus the wide choice and excellent value for money of breakfast foods offered .
not good service doing the room every day . parking is too expensive and hotel does not offer security for it , should be complementary for guests .
loved the location , old building , hardwood floors , historic elevators . . . yet modern bathroom and other room amenities . the breakfast was huge . . . so many choices . i ' ve stayed in many hie and this was by far the largest breakfast bar i ' d seen .
i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels and i have to say this was the worst breakfast i have experienced . no oatmeal or pancake batter ( it was not all gone , it was never set out ) .
softer bed . english speaking channels on tv . screen on door / window
especially not an express .
better wifi better breakfast options - pancake machine
i think the tavern is getting a little shabby the chairs in the bar were all worn out and had holes in the upholstery
the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out .
food choices in bar area . marble floor in shower is dangerous . double sink .
the water in the bathroom sink was warm / hot even when set to cold . . .
the room was outstanding , very comfortable bed and the furnishings just made the room very much like being at home . the touch lamp was a great addition to the work area .
the tv did not work .

this has always been my favorite hotel in baltimore but had to change rooms three times to find a room with a working heating system .
i m not the complaining type and didn t have much time to waste many hotels offer complimentary breakfast buffet .
if the price showed on the internet was what i was charged when i made my booking . they charged me $ 17 . 00 more than what was shown on your web site .
lifts have been broken since october . service charge added for a bar meal eaten in the bar ?
having the shower head on one wall and the water control valve on the opposite wall makes it very difficult .
we were attacked by ants in our bathroom during the stay and there were a lot of them . they were all over some food and tooth paste
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design . elevator was slow . i saw others at the bar shaking their heads and complains their food was wrong too .
fix the buffet breakfast .
guaranteed availability of preferred executive room on arrival when booked several months in advance
there was only a few pieces of fruit left . i asked the manager if there would be more fruit . he lied and said sure that plate was for another party . really ?
offering some type of free continental / full breakfast amenity .
my room was dusty , not vacuumed , and one of the bed stand lights was broken . the refrigerator was so loud it kept me up at night , so i turned it off . the hospitality staff was a + , but the housekeeping staff wasn ' t at the same level .
i think there could be more breakfast seating possibly
