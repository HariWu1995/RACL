sound insulation around the connecting doors between rooms - on one night there was a group of adults in the room next door talking reasonably loudly and the sound of their conversation and television came straight through the door .
but they were not clean . also the closet door mirrors had sticky hand prints on them . we were surprised at this .
1 1 . the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile . the tile grout in the shower was stained .
and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . loved our stay
much faster internet , a table to eat my food on , a clean room , no food left in the refridgerator , no left over trash on room floor and bathroom floor . a professional staff that delivers what they promise . no burned out lite bulbs .
would also be nice to be able to use the app to enter your room as well
better kids buffet - mash as well as chips , more veg choices , chicken leg and other non - fried mains . better coffee machines in the restaurant . they kept breaking and were nowhere near as good as coffee from the bar .
i had a suite room and the outer room of the suite was very warm and the air / fan or whatever it was called did not keep the room cool . we even left the door open of our bedroom but the a / c did not cool the room terrible ventilation .
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . there was queso , but there were no chips . . . i asked for chips & was told there weren ' t any ? so , i ' m not sure why there was queso ? this wont keep me from staying , i just thought it odd .
excellent service and help given by all members of staff with whom we came into contact . the cleanliness in all areas of the hotel , the efficiency of re stocking breakfast items and clearing of tables with minimum of fuss , plus the wide choice and excellent value for money of breakfast foods offered .
early morning softball games meant leaving the hotel right when breakfast was opened up to eat . we had to leave for a hame .
air conditioning not working was disappointing and hotel staff left our window open which was a security risk i was not happy with . apart from that rooms and front desk girls were great . breakfast was good value .
more attention is needed by cooking staff . breakfast was limited , would like to see more vegetarian options . room service did not show up until we requested . a door between the bedroom and the sink would prevent everyone waking up when someone uses the bathroom
the shop is well stocked with a good variety of good quality curios and other items .
a varied and tasty breakfast . powerful centralized air conditioning system . in general , i liked everything !
i also stayed at crown ' s plaza when travelled to hong kong , the services and variety of food are much better .
staff were extremely friendly and welcoming . i loved that the bar stayed open until two in the morning .
polite and clean . easy check in and out .
the food in the bar cafe was really bad . super salty , few healthy selections - ie the buffalo chicken wrap chicken was deep fried , didn ' t say that on the menu or i wouldn ' t have ordered it .
really ?
clean sheets and properly working equipment . . . . i thought i was going to puke when i rolled over the next morning and there was makeup all over the bottom sheet .
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design . elevator was slow . restaurant screwed up my meal . instead of remaking , he just scrapped the mushrooms off the steak and cooked the steak to well done . bartender was cool and bought me some beer but cook should be disciplined . i saw others at the bar shaking their heads and complains their food was wrong too .
the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile .
not sure . plumbing was bad . . . shower temps hot and cold . toilet was clogged when checked in . a few bugs in the room . . . maybe bugs could be removed . . . . . should check toilet before next person . . . .
newer facility , nice comfortable rooms , convenient location for my needs .
there was a stain on the cover of the pull out couch bed , so i wasn ' t sure how clean it was . we covered it with another sheet .
noise from bathroom upstairs
the hotel bar ' s music is way too loud , like it ' s a bellavista nightclub .
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . this wont keep me from staying , i just thought it odd .
were unsatisfactory have lived their life and need to be discarded . no no complimentry fruits .
would be nice to have the new chip card for rooms instead of the old magnetic strip . would also be nice to be able to use the app to enter your room as well so you don ' t even need a room key . bathroom also needs updated .
better breakfast options such as variety of fruits , cereal , and bread also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , but they need to improve on their friendliness .
bad service during breakfast at the restaurant .
it took a colleague to suggest shutting the air conditioner off instead of raising the temperature so that it did not come on ( limited ) . this would have been welcome advice from your porter .
the rooms are really small and the bathroom was super tiny and dirty . the front desk guy wouldn t let us check - in 30 mins early . will not stay here again ! the best western right up the road looks a lot nicer and easier to get to .
she pleasantly served me two poached eggs on toast as requested but a different assistant during the week would not budge from the menu ie .
check out needs to be improved - took 35 minutes and still wrpng - and was served bt duty manager
the hotel needs a beautiful garden or outdoor space behind it . i didn t understand how the windows all looked out on this depressing empty square of empty buildings .
breakfast in the morning was cold and poor quality .
food choices were limited and the waiting time when i ordered was very long . i needed to remind the staff what i had ordered and only received my food after 45 minutes .
housekeeping ensured that the room was clean and up to the standards .
i think there could be more breakfast seating possibly and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . although i didn t use either , they were backed up quite a bit . for the number of people , an extra would be helpful . but otherwise , breakfast was great and plenty of options .
room was clean and comfortable .
the rooms are really small and the bathroom was super tiny and dirty . the front desk guy wouldn t let us check - in 30 mins early . will not stay here again !
more variety of daily breakfast or to have the menu to be changed as i was there for 10 days and we were eating almost the same thing every day . with regard to food hygiene , there was no staff looking after the food and there were birds eating off the ingredients of the egg live station
took a long time for the heating to warm the roof bar meals were quite basic
bar could stay open a hour or 2 longer but other than that top quality hotel
some one to carry in my bags . having my check in requests addressed . a properly cleaned bath tube
no ice on our floor . 2 . no shower mat for bathtub . floor of bathtub had no texture and was very slippery .
when i asked for an 1 / 2 hour later check out , i was denied .
i want to do air conditioning control by myself
clean sheets and properly working equipment . . . . i thought i was going to puke when i rolled over the next morning and there was makeup all over the bottom sheet . i was not wearing makeup .
the breakfast was huge . . . so many choices . i ' ve stayed in many hie and this was by far the largest breakfast bar i ' d seen .
i needed to remind the staff what i had ordered and only received my food after 45 minutes .
i stayed the cover is gone noisy
bed , pillows and linens were comfortable . appreciated that there was a microwave and refrigerator in the room if i had a need for these . there were plenty of towels and wash cloths available in the room .
the breakfast was disappointing . the food was all processed and salty . sausage was dry and very spicy . we stayed the night before at a fairfield in toledo for $ 64 less . the food and seating area were just as nice .
great location . nice room with a beautiful view .
also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , but they need to improve on their friendliness . when i was checking out , i asked the hotel staff assistance with the computer and she wasn ' t customer service oriented nor friendly . also , as a member , i didnt get any welcome points or complimentary water
hotel is dark and old . bathroom was tiny , dark and poor design .
and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . for the number of people , an extra would be helpful .
breakfast was disappointing as no cooked items ( sausage or bacon ) available when we arrived at 9 . 30 on sunday , although eventually after a 15 minute wait some did arrive the croissant were then finished . there were a lot of people waiting meaning there was a shortage of seating .
the air con was not working and it wasn t an extremely hot day
i m not the complaining type and didn t have much time to waste
the water in the bathroom sink was warm / hot even when set to cold . . . when showering in the morning , the water temp lowered as the shower went on . two of my coworkers , who were also staying at this location , had the same experience .
breakfast : get rid of the pancake machine - the batter / pancakes come out yucky . a belgian waffle maker would be so much better !
this is the first hotel that i have ever stayed at that i had to pay for breakfast . instead of a free continental breakfast i was forced to pay $ 10 for breakfast and then an extra $ 2 for coffee at my breakfast table when there was free coffee 50 feet away outside the restaurant .
great bed , staff was very polite .
that ' s why i stay at the holiday inn hotels !
our service was friendly , prompt , and we were greeted with smiling , friendly personnel for our entire stay . the staff could not have been more accommodating .
bed seemed harder than what i ve come to expect .
really disappointed by the breakfast . both days the cooked breakfast was cold and myself and others complained . we told staff but no one seemed to bother too much or any improvement occur .
this is not only an allergy issue but potential for fire .
the room was very comfortable and clean . i also ordered room service and it was delicious !
the room was clean , the bed was comfortable and the bathroom had all amenities . staff were extremely friendly and welcoming . i loved that the bar stayed open until two in the morning . free breakfast was something i hadn t expected .
hotel staff were very helpful .
the beds were hard 3 )
1 1 ) improved food served in the restaurant . 2 ) notify me of all the services provided within the offer you chose , i did not know that the dinner was covered during my stay . 3 ) no condoms inside the room use it to enter the cold floor water cycle .
we came down to breakfast around 7 : 30 and were the only ones there .
the elevator broke and we had to lug all of our luggage and packages down the stairs - very cumbersome
not all wines available and some spirits .
not so overpowering with the air freshener used . but it was still strong the next day .
luggage carts near the front entrance
so the temperature was quite uncomfortable especially at night .
breakfast was hot , ready and plentiful .
loved the location , old building , hardwood floors , historic elevators . . . yet modern bathroom and other room amenities .
great job
the hotel and room was clean and the sleep spray a nice touch .
staff always friendly with fast check in
they didn t tell us until we brought all of our luggage inside .
for the price i paid to stay , i thought i ' d see a more robust breakfast offering . bananas were very freckled .
service was completely top notch .
the vent / fan cover was off in the bathroom . obviously , the mechanism hadn ' t been cleaned in years . this is not only an allergy issue but potential for fire . recommend that all the bathroom vents are cleaned !
missed the ambience of a hotel bar
the next our was spent with employees banging on the door and yelling .
mushrooms and / or tomatoes for breakfast . we were not aware or the industrial cleaning evening when we could not use the bar / dining area to sit in .
the facility was beautiful and centrally located . staff were friendly and accommodating .
the restaurant selections could ve included more local selections .
breakfast : get rid of the pancake machine - the batter / pancakes come out yucky .
cleanliness of the room .
the restaurant could have longer breakfast hours . room service could be better .
at breakfast , with another hour for the buffet , i witnessed the manager tell a waitress to take a plate of fruit back to the kitchen . there was only a few pieces of fruit left . i asked the manager if there would be more fruit . he lied and said sure that plate was for another party . no more fruit at 1000 .
it was cold in my room ( cold weather ) . it took a colleague to suggest shutting the air conditioner off instead of raising the temperature so that it did not come on ( limited ) .
staff were friendly and accommodating . but i am grateful for at least free coffee in the lobby .
the all dasy food menu was excellent , covering all tastes and
better selection of food at the bar
cheaper prices at the bar , more teas & coffees in the rooms .
i have stayed at many holiday inns as i mentioned on my recent review on trip advisory . the staff , the crown and moose the ladies in the breakfast room amazing comfortable beds .
storing luggage with duty free items
the staff in the restaurant were excellent . when they heard that i could not eat many of the items on the breakfast buffet , they offered to individually cook some egg whites for me , which i really appreciated .
i expected to have slippers at this grade of hotel .
we found the bar prices a tad high .
that seemed excessively early . i ' d like the ability to sleep or go for breakfast and head out for the day before someone shows up at the door .
comfortable bed . breakfast served early .
not good service doing the room every day . parking is too expensive and hotel does not offer security for it , should be complementary for guests .
plenty of coffee .
more attention is needed by cooking staff . breakfast was limited , would like to see more vegetarian options .
you ' re going to say you had large groups so if you knew it then you should have had more staff on those days .
it feel like it was ran by a true team / family .
we were on the second , right next to the elevator
plumbing was bad . . . toilet was clogged when checked in .
checking took 20 minutes , too long
breakfast was of quality , and the waitress left the pot of coffee on the table . i watched a new hire being trained on the buffet line by the chef . i was impressed with this level of supervision being provided to insure quality food service .
when i was checking out , i asked the hotel staff assistance with the computer
1 1 . the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile . the tile grout in the shower was stained . the tub drain looked filthy . 3 . the noise from the air conditioning units on the adjacent building was excessively loud and disturbing .
maintenance / renovation of some of the rooms and building .
service great from maks , issue with previous guest not checking out on time , apologised and kept updated on progress . apology when finally checking in and without any need to ask was offered complimentary parking . great c / s one step ahead
the service was friendly , the rooms were clean and the breakfast was awesome
customer service . front desk does not know how to take initiatives . when checking in it took the 3rd room to get it right . no tv in first one and the 2nd suite did doors did not lock .
usb chargers in room .
the batter / pancakes come out yucky . these ones tasted awful ( i didn ' t know you could have bad english muffins ) .
front desk does not know how to take initiatives . not acceptable .
there were zero bottles of any beer , two dinner items i asked about , they were out .
the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . 3 .
not sure what the person ' s job was that seated us , but she had plenty of time to get coffee and do other jobs .
great service . friendly and helpful staff . great breakfast , even on christmas eve and christmas when many were being served .
ordered food at 6 : 30pm , got food at 7 : 45pm . really long wait . also , the bar staff didn ' t tell me you were out of certain meals when order was placed .
the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the tub drain looked filthy .
the staff were all very friendly , polite and hospitable . i felt very welcome . the room was very comfortable . the sports bar has a great relaxed atmosphere .
wait , there it is ' .
good service from staff . clean facilities
" the receptionist was very courteous , friendly , helpful and professional .
some one to carry in my bags .
i thought i was going to puke when i rolled over the next morning and there was makeup all over the bottom sheet . i was not wearing makeup .
also the service in the bar was slow .
i waited 1 hr .
mosquito spray in rooms would have been helpful
the hotel was not a clean as i expected it to be . there was torn wallpaper near the elevator and the hallways and gym were very hot and humid . it ' s not very pleasant to go work out in a gym that is just as hot and humid as outside .
the vent / fan cover was off in the bathroom . this is not only an allergy issue but potential for fire .
free airport shuttle , much better than average gym for a hotel
too old building and interior
rooms were clean , clean towels , and no bed bugs .
pretty noisy with kids running up & down hallways from one room to another . it was christmas weekend , so there were families in different places and kids were allowed to run wild . the staff did take care of it when we complained .
such 24hr pool area access
i stick to vegan food and was upset about the lack of breakfast choices for me .
clean rooms with all amenities . very nice staff
this has always been my favorite hotel in baltimore but had to change rooms three times to find a room with a working heating system . water had to run about 15 minutes to get hot .
a bar that was open , music that pretended to make people want to be there villas that were not crumbling and falling down this resort needs some serious work
the roof top bar environment shd be such where single women can sit and ejoy a drink too .
and she wasn ' t customer service oriented nor friendly .
room was large andnew and clean . nice pool and good breakfast . plenty of coffee .
better coffee machines in the restaurant . consider some consoles and some big lego bricks .
location of the hotel makes it easy to walk downtown gatlinburg
the breakfast was disappointing . the food was all processed and salty .
restaurant service was slow .
i forgot my breakfast coupon and the front desk gave me a coupon rather than me having to go all the way back to my room . housekeeping was great . i received change easily for the coffee main in the lobby . they helped out changing my key that did ' t work . the whole experience met my needs for my 4 day stay !
the internet connection cuts in and out .
both days the cooked breakfast was cold and myself and others complained . we told staff but no one seemed to bother too much or any improvement occur .
early morning softball games meant leaving the hotel right when breakfast was opened up to eat .
the air con was not working and it wasn t an extremely hot day so the temperature was quite uncomfortable especially at night .
there were only meat choices . . . turkey sandwiches & chicken noodle soup ( both looked delicious ! ) i put together a salad . there was queso , but there were no chips . . .
the parking lot was big enough for all the guests .
the breakfast was disappointing . the food was all processed and salty . sausage was dry and very spicy .
more attention is needed by cooking staff . breakfast was limited , would like to see more vegetarian options . room service did not show up until we requested .
i m planning a family reunion here in 2020 and hope the dinner food improves before then or we will dine elsewhere for dinner
easy access of main motorway . room pleasant and large enough for our family . use of gym and pool great .
better breakfast . i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels
i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels the hotel was not that busy the night we stayed .
the food for dinner was uninspired and more expensive than o expected ( i don t mind paying high prices for good food ) the food at breakfast was much better , so was the service .
offering some type of free continental / full breakfast amenity .
each and every staff member was pleasant and extremely helpful . keep up the amazing work .
the customer service representative that took my reservation never told me about a credit card being need to hold a $ 20 incidentals fee
the food in the bar was very nice for dinner , and breakfast was great also .
noise from people in corridor outside . .
apology when finally checking in and without any need to ask was offered complimentary parking . great c / s one step ahead
both days the cooked breakfast was cold and myself and others complained . we told staff but no one seemed to bother too much or any improvement occur . also our request of a roll away bed was not auctioned until we highlighted this . finally the hand wash and shower wash was empty
internet connection would not hold on laptop . room temp was 61 with ac on when we arrived . poor lighting at desk area . nightstand clock set on 24 hour display .
perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays .
had to wait and to get attention when i first arrived . no one paying attention at the front desk .
both days the cooked breakfast was cold and myself and others complained . also our request of a roll away bed was not auctioned until we highlighted this .
bar service could be more engaging and proactive and anticipating our needs whilst awaiting our meal , e . g g . , we did not know where cutlery , condiments where and left to source them ourselves etc
the staff were all very friendly , polite and hospitable . i felt very welcome . the room was very comfortable . the sports bar has a great relaxed atmosphere . the shop is well stocked with a good variety of good quality curios and other items . food / meals were excellent .
from reception to the waiters in the bar and the restaurant and from the valet at the door till the house keeping staff in the corridors . well done ! rooms were well appointed , very clean and the bed comfort was excellent !
there was only a few pieces of fruit left . i asked the manager if there would be more fruit . he lied and said sure that plate was for another party . really ?
new clean facilities and courteous staff
i stayed
there was also fridge , microwave , and keurig in the room .
the breakfast was disappointing . the food was all processed and salty . sausage was dry and very spicy . we stayed the night before at a fairfield in toledo for $ 64 less . the food and seating area were just as nice . the room was larger and also very clean . for that amount of money we expected more .
service was completely top notch . each and every staff member was pleasant and extremely helpful .
the bar is open longer for a drink with friends , after a visit to ethias arena or theater , so after 23 hours . the heating was insufficient and the bathroom too small .
more seating ( other than the high beds and one chair ) , we stayed for 4 nights so wanted to use drawers for clothing . . . but they were not clean . also the closet door mirrors had sticky hand prints on them . we were surprised at this .
need to check food quality before it goes out
1 1 . the breakfast buffet food meeds to be fresher . the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out . perhaps cook smaller amounts when leaving food in the warming trays . 2 . the room was horribly run down . the bathroom tile fixes didn ' t match existing tile .
convenient location to activities , downtown and hwy access
from reception to the waiters in the bar and the restaurant and from the valet at the door till the house keeping staff in the corridors . rooms were well appointed , very clean and the bed comfort was excellent !
ordered food at 6 : 30pm , got food at 7 : 45pm .
1 ) the pool area had some mold or rust growing in some areas 2 ) the cinnamon rolls at breakfast were under a heat lamp but they were still cold ; overall the food was not good
i loved the bar and the food in the cafe de la paix .
early morning softball games meant leaving the hotel right when breakfast was opened up to eat . also breakfast needed to get refilled more often . by the time we came down on sunday at 9 there was nothing left and
more seating ( other than the high beds and one chair ) , we stayed for 4 nights so wanted to use drawers for clothing . . . but they were not clean . also the closet door mirrors had sticky hand prints on them .
music in the bar on the top floor , it was really old school and too loud
the bed was very hard was not comfortable at all
fix the buffet breakfast . the food was cold . they appear to be cooking mounds of food early am and then holding it in the back and keep adding to the buffet as needed . the new food brought out and added to the buffet is cold so that is how i know it
window into lobby was weird and made room noisey
the location is just the right distance to be away from the crowds but convenient for access to downtown copenhagen and the airport .
convenient location . every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and professional .
so could have fresh air without bugs coming in .
road noise from window that was shut but sounded as if it was open ? noise from people in corridor outside . . we had no sleep ! noise from bathroom upstairs , there was a high pitched noise when water was used ?
i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels and i have to say this was the worst breakfast i have experienced . no oatmeal or pancake batter ( it was not all gone , it was never set out ) .
more options for the menu in the bar .
the roof top bar environment shd be such where single women can sit and ejoy a drink too . there was too much of a loud punjabi music and only men in there
cutlery ran out and had to ask for some too .
best pool i ' ve seen in a hotel .
install bath tubs in the rooms and refrigerator
if the bathroom is not clean the whole room becomes questionable .
there was blood all over the carpet and not enough lights in parking lot with drug deals going on where my vehicle was parked .
better wifi better breakfast options - pancake machine
when a continental breakfast is included with my room , i usually expect to be able to make it to an early lunch on what is served at that breakfast .
i think the tavern is getting a little shabby the chairs in the bar were all worn out and had holes in the upholstery
the eggs , bacon , and sausage were all dried out .
we had evening drinks there and bar could look nicer though again the staff compensate for the unfinished look of the bar . the restaurant breakfast / brunch was quite good
the bathroom cleanliness was questionable and room service failed to respond to our request . if the bathroom is not clean the whole room becomes questionable . used wipes to clean dirty surfaces .
the price was great , the room had a nice view , and everything was very clean and well - decorated ! the kilowatt restaurant provided a lovely breakfast .
the water in the bathroom sink was warm / hot even when set to cold . . .
most of the staff were hospitable . breakfast was hot , ready and plentiful .

very friendly staff at check - in and the managers reception .
comfortable room , great parking , friendly staff
room service was horrible . shrimp poboy and chicken sandwich bread were both hard as a rock . need to check food quality before it goes out
and there was makeup all over the bottom sheet .
screen on door / window
having the shower head on one wall and the water control valve on the opposite wall makes it very difficult .
we were attacked by ants in our bathroom during the stay and there were a lot of them . they were all over some food and tooth paste
i have stayed at a lot of holiday inn express hotels and i have to say this was the worst breakfast i have experienced . there was only one cinnamon roll .

fix the buffet breakfast .
the hotel was dirty . the sink in my room was basically broke . the window in my room was stuck open and i couldn t shut it so there was noise from the traffic all night .
and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . although i didn t use either , they were backed up quite a bit . loved our stay
a variety in breakfast would also be a plus .
good wi - fi connection . enjoyed the breakfast and the eating area .
reception was excellent on arrival .
room clean and big .
also making sure the utensil trays are filled , without having to be asked three times to refill .
free continental breafast
they were frozen and would take forever to thaw . crazy ! should have food of all kinds available if on the menu . we ordered caesar salad and chicken wings and they were at a great price and delicious .
the hotel needs a beautiful garden or outdoor space behind it .
room pleasant and large enough for our family . use of gym and pool great . easy reach of attractions in surrounding area .
super warm pool - thank you ! loved the complimentary bottled water , coffee and fruit , and loved the brain teasers and what not , though i forgot to turn mine in for the raffle .   : )
other things are much more to fix
free wifi .
the staff were all very friendly , polite and hospitable . food / meals were excellent .
the restaurant was also closed on thursday night when i was expecting to eat there

the price was great , the room had a nice view , and everything was very clean and well - decorated !
also , they need to improve their business center , for instance the printer wasn ' t working . overall , the hotel staff was very cordial , but they need to improve on their friendliness . when i was checking out , i asked the hotel staff assistance with the computer

good service during reservation and during stay , cozy atmosphere in lobby & bar , very clean and nice room , balcony , nice pool and very nice that a bathrobe and bath towel were available and only check out at 12 o ' clock was very nice .
and i d recommend an extra waffle maker and toaster . although i didn t use either , they were backed up quite a bit . for the number of people , an extra would be helpful . but otherwise , breakfast was great and plenty of options .
the food and seating area were just as nice .
better coffee machines in the restaurant . they kept breaking and were nowhere near as good as coffee from the bar . children s play area very tired in terms of the toys . consider some consoles and some big lego bricks .
but i had to ask the lobby ; one night , by bed was not made .
the staff was rude , the hotel was dirty and had boxes full of heaters in the lobby . in addition the room was out dated and needed to have new pillows , new pull out coach mattress that included bedding .
there was only a few pieces of fruit left . i asked the manager if there would be more fruit . really ?
